<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I´m a woman, a wife, a mother. <br/>
   I try to keep priorities according to the written order. <br/>
   It´s enought for this period of life and I love the way it is- being a woman, a wife to my husband and a mother to three wonderful children. Although it is not always easy. <br/>
   But what is always easy?</p>

<p>I love people, but also being alone. <br/>
  I enjoy learning new skills, being in a motion, being outdoor, doing some crafts and writing.   </p>

<p>I am on the way to knowing who I really am and what my mission or passion is. <br/>
   I think I already understood the basics, the rest probably became clear in time.
